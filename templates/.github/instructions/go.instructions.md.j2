## Code Style and Standards

- Keep functions small and focused

## Best Practices
- Use go mod for dependency management
- Write unit tests using the testing package
- Handle errors explicitly - don't ignore them
- Use context.Context for cancellation and timeouts
- Follow the "accept interfaces, return structs" principle

## Project Structure
- Organize code into logical packages
- Use main package only for entry points
- Keep internal packages truly internal
- Use cmd/ directory for executables

## Repository Types: {{ types | join(', ') }}
- Follow Go best practices for {{ types | join(', ') }} repositories
