# YAML Instructions for {{ repo_name }}

## Structure and Format

- Use explicit document start (---) and end (...) markers when needed
- Keep lines under 120 characters when possible

## Best Practices
- Use descriptive keys that clearly indicate their purpose
- Group related configuration items logically
- Include comments for complex configurations
- Validate YAML syntax before committing

## Repository Types: {{ types | join(', ') }}
- Follow YAML conventions appropriate for {{ types | join(', ') }} types
