# Terraform Instructions for {{ repo_name }}

## Code Style and Standards
- Use consistent naming conventions: snake_case for resources and variables
- Always include descriptions for variables and outputs
- Use data sources instead of hardcoded values when possible
- Follow the standard module structure: main.tf, variables.tf, outputs.tf
- Use locals for computed values and complex expressions

## Best Practices
- Always include version constraints for providers
- Use terraform fmt before committing
- Include validation rules for variables when appropriate
- Use meaningful resource names that reflect their purpose
- Add tags to all resources that support them

## Repository Types: {{ types | join(', ') }}
- Follow Terraform best practices for {{ types | join(', ') }} repositories
- Use provider-specific data sources for dynamic values
- Implement proper IAM policies with least privilege principle
